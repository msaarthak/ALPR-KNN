# alprcnn
This repository contains a system that performs Automatic License Plate Recognition using Machine Learning classifier K-Nearest Neighbors. This project was performed with the help of YouTuber Chris Dahms.  You can find his Github repositories here: - https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore

This project was also performed under the supervision of Dr. Shan Du. She specializes in the field of Computer Vision and her work can be accessed here: - http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~shand/

This project was performed using the code in this repo:- https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV_3_License_Plate_Recognition_Cpp
 We used C++ and Visual Studio to perform ALPR using KNN.
